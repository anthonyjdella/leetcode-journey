Built in Python3 Data Structures:
1. List
2. Tuple
3. Set 

Other Data Structures
4. Dictionary
5. Stack 
6. Queue
7. Min-Max Heap
8. Linked List
9. Double Linked List
10. Circular Linked List
11. Binary Search Tree
12. Trie
13. n-ary tree 
14. Directed Graph (with Adjacency List)
    i. Adjacency List (Sparse Graphs)
15. Undirected Graph (with Adjacency Matrix)
    i. Adjacency Matrix (Dense Graphs)



Roadmap to solving any question if 100% stuck: 
Recursion -> Linked list -> Stack -> Queue -> Two pointers -> Sliding-window -> hashing -> sorting -> binary search -> trees -> BST -> Heaps -> Graph basics -> BFS -> DFS -> backtracking -> greedy -> Dynamic programming -> advanced graph -> Union find -> bit manipulation.

TIPS
~~~~~~
If input array is sorted then
    - Binary search
    - Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then
    - Backtracking

If given a tree then
    - DFS
    - BFS

If given a graph then
    - DFS
    - BFS

If given a linked list then
    - Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
    - Stack

If must solve in-place then
    - Swap corresponding values
    - Store one or more different values in the same pointer

If asked for maximum/minumum subarray/subset/options then
    - Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
    - Heap

If asked for common strings then
    - Map
    - Trie

Else
    - Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
    - Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
